**Resume Cheat Sheet**
---------------

✅ Use a pre-designed resume template    
✅ Make the resume fit on 1 page   
✅ Include words from job description  
✅ Include company name you are applying to  
✅ Does your first item on your resume reflect what they are looking for?  
✅ Experience titles demonstrate value  
✅ Do you have an online link?  
✅ Remove the word “I”  
✅ No buzzwords describing how great you are  
✅ Are you using Action words?  
✅ Measure everything in terms of impact, don’t just describe your responsibilities  
✅ Technical Knowledge/Skills should include what they are looking for. Only show years if it is impressive  
✅ Include only sections/items that are impressive: Experience, Projects, Education, Technical Skills  
✅ No typos or bad grammar  


**Optional Exercise: Github Master**
---------------

Please note that this is completely optional (mainly for fun) exercise.

Don't have a good Github history? Don't worry! If you are looking to add a little flare to your Github profile, which a lot of recruiters check, you can try using this tool: https://github.com/aneagoie/gitfiti

It will generate a file for you full of git commands which you will be able to run and design your Github history whichever way you want. Make sure you read the instructions and understand what it does!

The changes may take a few hours to take effect. If you succeeded, congrats! You just finished the easiest, and silliest exercise of this course!

    Hey $BOB,
    I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
    Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
    $COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
    I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
    or $ROLE. I’d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
    few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?
     
    Thanks,
    Yourname
    Your website or any public profile link
```
